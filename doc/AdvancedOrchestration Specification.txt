* Types of triggers and execution flow definition

- Finish to start: 

     finish A to start B

     $serviceA | ^serviceB
     or
     serviceA | serviceB 

- Start to finish

     start A to finish B (precondition serviceC | serviceB or just serviceB)

     serviceB ; (^serviceA | $serviceB)
     

- Start to start 

     start A to start B (equates to parallel execution)

     (^serviceA | ^serviceB)

- Finish to finish

     finish B to finish A

     (^serviceA | ^serviceB) ; ($serviceB | $serviceA)


- Custom/Internal events:

   Suspended
 

* Host tagging:

   - Services need to be associated to an abstract host, via tags
     (serviceA@db* | serviceB@) 

   - If no host is specified, the framework will attempt to run the operation
     at the same host where the command is invoked from.           


* Assumptions and conventions:

1. There should be only one mention of a single service (with no pipes).
   That service will be assumed to be the starting point of the execution
2. Unchained service invocations should be separated by ;


* Potential use cases
